# gcf

My per-package cflags on Gentoo Linux.

These are my current flags.

## The default make.conf *FLAGS:

* CFLAGS="-march=native -Os -fno-inline -freorder-blocks-algorithm=simple
-fomit-frame-pointer -frename-registers -fno-plt -mindirect-branch=thunk
-mindirect-branch-register -flto=thin -fopt-info-vec -pipe"

* CXXFLAGS="${CFLAGS}"

* LDFLAGS="${LDFLAGS} -flto=thin"

## Additional implicit hardened flags

My current profile is hardened and comes with the following built in defaults ON:

* -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -- for buffer overflow protection
* -fstack-protector-strong -param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -- medium buffer overflow
							checking
* -fstack-clash-protection  -- protect against this class of attacks when
				heap and stack clash with each other with
				a program/daemon running as root (suid)
* -Wl,relro -Wl,now -- Full RELRO for LDFLAGS to close hole to prevent
			arbitrary code execution of overritten GOT entry
			of jump address

These flags are also default ON via a modified ebuild with hardened clang
is on the [oiledmachine-overlay](http://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay).

PGO (profile-guided optimization) is done on the ebuild level instead of these
the environment variables because they require some training assets and maybe
some additional coding.  Modified packages with support for PGO flags
(-fprofile-generate/-fprofile-use) can be found in the
[PGO section](https://github.com/orsonteodoro/oiledmachine-overlay#pgo-packages).
in the the same overlay.

## Package placement strategy at these target compiler optimization levels

* O3 -- enabled for only 3D math and 3D game engines, computational geometry 
algorithms, bitwise math, physics libraries and engines, FFT, audio and video 
codecs and image processing
* O2 -- non turn based games, assembly like code, parsers, crypto
* Os -- default

## Reasons for the chosen flags

* -fprefetch-loop-arrays is enabled for package that process sequential data.
* -ftree-parallelize-loops=4 is enabled for single threaded libraries with 
plenty of data (e.g. pixel manipulation libraries).  Change 4 to the number of 
cores on your system.
* -fomit-frame-pointer -frename-registers are enabled to maximize register use
* -ffast-math is enabled for 3D games, game engines and libraries, and audio 
processing.  For those using bullet for scientific purposes, consider removing 
fast-math (or applying [[1]](#footnote1)).
* -fopt-info-vec -- show SIMD optimized loops [[3]](#footnote3)
* -flto -- used primarily for reduction of binary size and cache use
efficiency [[4]](#footnote4)

For Spectre mitigation virtually all packages were filtered with Retpoline
compiler support with these flags:

* -mindirect-branch=thunk -mindirect-branch-register (the GCC version) --
compiled for most apps if not stripped by ebuild.
* -mretpoline (found in clang-retpoline.conf) -- the Clang version [[5]](#footnote5)
* -Wl,-z,retpolineplt -- for lazy binded shared libraries or drivers.
It is recommended to use Clang + LLD when applying these LDFLAGS as
a Spectre v2 mitigation strategy.
* -fno-plt -- for now binded shared libraries as a Spectre mitigation
strategy.[[2]](#footnote2)

One may remove -mindirect-branch=thunk -mindirect-branch-register 
if the processor has already fixed the side-channel attack hardware flaw. 
According to Wikipedia, just about all pre 2019 hardware had this flaw.

To ensure that your kernel is properly patched use 
`cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/spectre_v2` to view if the 
Spectre mitigation works.  It should report `Mitigation: Full AMD retpoline` 
or `Mitigation: Full generic retpoline`.  On my machine it reports the former.

To ensure that all Meltdown and Spectre mitigations are in place for the Linux 
kernel do `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/*`.

It should look like:

<pre>
Not affected
Mitigation: __user pointer sanitization
Mitigation: Full AMD retpoline
</pre>

You may also try `lscpu` to obtain more info about CPU hardware vulnerabilities.

This test was performed circa Mar 2018 with sys-devel/gcc-7.3.0-r1, 
llvm-core/clang-6.0.9999, llvm-core/llvm-6.0.9999, sys-devel/binutils-2.30. 
It used sys-kernel/zen-sources-4.15.9999 from cynede's overlay and enabled 
-O3 (Compiler optimization level: Optimize harder), -march=native (Processor 
family (Native optimizations autodetected by GCC)).  The native optimization 
comes from GraySky2's patch and the Optimize Harder is a zen-kernel patch 
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/c41ed11fc416424d508803f861b6042c8c75f9ba.

Entries for inclusion for the package.env are only those installed or may in 
 the future be installed on my system.

<a name="footnote1">[1]</a> I_WANT_LOSSLESS=1 can be added to make.conf or
applied per-package to remove or convert flags to their lossless counterparts
in packages related to games, graphics, audio.

<a name="footnote2">[2]</a> If you have a package that does lazy binding
(i.e. LDFLAGS=-Wl,lazy), then -fno-plt is not compatible with that package
especially the x11-drivers.  You need to add a
`${CATEGORY}/${PN} disable-fno-plt.conf z-retpolineplt.conf`
row in the package.env. This assumes that the contents of the bashrc have been
copied into /etc/portage/bashrc or sourced from an external file.

<a name="footnote3">[3]</a> If you have a clang package, you may need to add a
`${CATEGORY}/${PN} disable-fopt-info.conf` row to disable fopt-info since
this is only a GCC only flag if it is not auto removed.

<a name="footnote4">[4]</a> Not all packages can successfully use LTO.  Both
remove-clang-lto.conf and remove-gcc-lto.conf has been provided to remove the
flag for select packages.  You may only choose one LTO compiler from
beginning to end.  If a package doesn't support the chosen systemwide LTO
default, you must strip the -flto flag from that package especially if that
package produces a static library.

<a name="footnote5">[5]</a> Sometimes I may choose mostly built @world with
clang or with gcc.  You may choose to switch between -mindirect-branch=thunk or
-mretpoline for the default {C,CXX}FLAGS and apply manually per-package
clang-retpoline.conf or gcc-retpoline-thunk.conf.  It helps to grep the
saved build logs to determine which packages should rebuild with retpoline.
Adding to the make.conf with envvars PORTAGE_LOGDIR="/var/log/emerge/build-logs"
and FEATURES="${FEATURES} binpkg-logs" then grepping them can help discover
which packages need a per-package retpoline or which package needs
an -fno-plt or -fopt-info-vec removal scripts.

## Files involved

* bashrc -- used to dynamically modify *FLAGS
* env/*.conf -- per-package config definitions
* gen_pkg_lists.sh -- generator for LTO blacklist and whitelists, and CFI lists
* make.conf -- contains default *FLAGS to be modified manually on your end.
DO NOT `cp ${REPO_DIR}/make.conf /etc/portage/make.conf`
* package.cfi_ignore -- per-package CFI ignore list (Allow / Permit rules.
Limited to build time and common use or basic features.  Expand for your use
case.)
* package.env -- per-package and per-category config

## bashrc

The bashrc script is also provided to control applying, removing, translating
*FLAGS and adjusting MAKEOPTS.  You may place it and source it in an external
script, or place it directly in the bashrc.  Per-package environment variables
are used to control *FLAG filtering.
