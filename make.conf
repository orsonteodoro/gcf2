# MAKEOPTS levels:
#
#   -j$((${NCORES} * ${MPROCS})) = \
#			     Normal and tuned for throughput.  Trys to resist \
#			     empty pool of work caused by IO waits.  Used by \
#			     most packages except for large ones.  MPROCS is \
#			     a multiplier for the number of processes to spawn. \
#			     This corresponds to makeopts-normal.conf.
#
#   -j$((${NCORES} / 2))   = Swappy.  Assumes some work is better than no \
#			     work.  For example, a 4 actual core machine will \
#			     have 2 empty page lanes reserved per swap \
#			     transfer and 2 corresponding active page lanes \
#			     for goodput.  Use this if it appears that the \
#			     swap overhead appears to be counterproductive or \
#			     when multitasking severely is not working \
#			     properly. This corresponds to makeopts-swappy.conf.
#
#   -j${NCORES}		   = Plain.  One thread per core.  Not recommended \
#			     because of the possibility of disk IO waits can \
#			     cause a core be underutilized. \
#			     This corresponds to makeopts-plain.conf.
#
#   -j1			   = OOM resistant.  Again assumes some work is better \
#			     than no work. \
#			     This corresponds to makeopts-oom.conf or \
#			     makeopts-broken.conf.
#
# The below NCORES value is the number of actual CPU cores not multiplied by \
# threads per core.
#
# This also implies you have 4 * ${MPROCS} * ${NCORES} GiB of total uncompressed
# memory or (4 * ${MPROCS} * ${NCORES}) / 2.1 GiB of total memory with
# zswap compression.  Not providing enough total memory can lead to OOM (Out of
# Memory), forced resets, and loss of unsaved work (data loss).
